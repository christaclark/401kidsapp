ID: in JS is a special identifying number 
Div: is a relational thing 
Solution: if it is true, it does something, shows a return 
Slug: make sure you have a machine readable name (you can use it for stuff like accesssing a div with an id)
Items: numbers that relate to a particular group 

console.log 

Traverse: get the file and load it to Json and it becomes the object I'm working with "OBJ" is the data string
- Use the "each" fucntion to iterate through everything
